Download the .pbix file created by Harshit Kedia and open it in Power BI desktop to interact with the dynamic visualisations designed to give useful insights on Sales data of our countrywide store chain: https://tinyurl.com/HarshitPowerBIProject


Some background information:

Our store chain FirstChoice' sales director was unable to get proper information about the performance of sales of various zones because it is difficult to comprehend tabular data in a short time, so we designed interactive visualisations of the csv and  sql  tabular data after proper data cleaning and analysis so that the company's sales director can get useful insights quickly and effortlessly
